Okay, this is the "day job" rather than a project, but I've included it in my projects list since it's consuming most of my time.

I've been working with the business since July 2022, initially as a consultant, then joining as a full-time CTO in Jan 2023.

In that time, I have worked with nearly all areas of the company to bring together a product which is now undergoing it's first clinical trial. I continue to work with the science teams on new versions of the algorithms, clinicians on the safety and effectiveness of the products, and with the business development team to build something suitable for our target customers.

The team is still small, however, there are other developers contributing to the code.

It's enormously rewarding to work on a project which stands a chance of improving people's lives in a very tangible way.
