What I liked about this book:
1. Really confronting that it's not simply "me problem" preventing me from meeting all of the commitments on my time - there are just too many things to do
2. It's actually very normal to not feel totally in control, and it's probably best to accept that it probably always will feel that way.
3. The concept of "Decide in advance what to fail at"

Favourite quote:
> "To put things as mildly as possible, itâ€™s hard to remain entirely confident that everything will turn out fine." - Oliver Burkeman

Undestatement of the century.
