Okay, this is the "day job" rather than a project, but I've included it in my projects list since it consumed most of my time when I worked for the company between 2022 and 2025.

In that time, I worked with nearly all areas of the company to bring together a product which is now undergoing it's second/third clinical trial. I continue to work with the science teams on new versions of the algorithms, clinicians on the safety and effectiveness of the products, and with the business development team to build something suitable for our target customers.

It was enormously rewarding to work on a project which stands a chance of improving people's lives in a very tangible way.
