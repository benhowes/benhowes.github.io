[Capable Koala](https://capablekoala.co) develops a range of plugins (primarily for monday.com) through the Capable Koala brand. We're a monday.com marketplace partner, and have 1000's of users of apps on monday.com.

More recently, we've also developed a new suite of Atlassian plugins for Jira and Confluence to aid in the work of healthtech/medtech companies working in Jira (for QMS and requirements management).
