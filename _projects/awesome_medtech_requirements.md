See [Awesome MedTech Requirements on GitHub](https://github.com/benhowes/awesome-medtech-requirements) for the list of resources.

I've started a project to collect a list of resources for medtech companies working in Jira (for QMS and requirements management). This is intended to be for the benefit of engineers and product owners working in medtech and healthtech companies.

I'm hoping that the list grows over time and can incorperate the latest new tools and processes to help folks move fast and _not_ break things.
