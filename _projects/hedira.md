> FYI: We sold Hedira in December 2021 and the new owner has unfortunately not continued to develop Hedira due to some challenging personal circumstances. The app and website are no longer functional.

Hedira ~~is~~was a complete houseplant care app offering species-specific, day-to-day houseplant care advice which is customised for the conditions of the space you keep your plant in. The app also offers journalling, ways to find new plants, and help with common problems.

I joined Jess shortly after she'd made a first prototype in order to help take the concept to a broader set of users and with more features. We brought in Robb who documented his experience of working on the project here: https://orke.design/work/hedira
