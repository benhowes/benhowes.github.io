A weird thing happened at the weekend. I saw [Gina Trapani's "my life in weeks"](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/), and then no more than an hour later, I was listening to Sam Harris talk and he mentioned the infamous [Your life in weeks post on "wait but why"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), which is what Gina's version credits too.

Given [Gina](https://ginatrapani.org/) was so kind to publish her work under an MIT license, I decided that I had to make my own version.

You can see the result of my efforts at [https://ben-howes.co.uk/life-in-weeks/](https://ben-howes.co.uk/life-in-weeks/).

It feels like a deeply personal thing which I can't imagine anyone else caring about, but it was something I wanted to do myself. Enjoy.


Should you feel interested, you can:
1. If you're comfortable with code, you can clone [my version](https://github.com/benhowes/life-in-weeks), or [Gina's original versioni](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks).
2. If not, there's [an online tool where you can make your own](https://www.weeksofyour.life/)
