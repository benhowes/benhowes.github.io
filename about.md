Hi, I’m Ben. I like to work with people, make things and ultimately solve problems. I’m based in Bristol, UK.

My skills are largely in: Python, Full-stack web development, C, 3D printing & Electronic design. Due to this, I’ve been involved in working on IoT projects.

For 5 years through to June 2018 I have been building Zoetrope Labs, however I have decided to go a different way and as such I’m available for contracting roles, either in Bristol or mostly remote for other locations. The easiest way to reach me is through linkedin.
